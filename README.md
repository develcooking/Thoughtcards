#### Description:
Thoughtcards CLI is a versatile command-line interface application designed to facilitate the creation and management of flashcards and decks. Modeled after the [Memorado](https://github.com/wbernard/Memorado) application, Thoughtcards CLI offers users a structured way to create, edit, rename, and delete decks and cards, making it ideal for personal study and educational purposes. 

At the heart of the application is an SQLite database, which stores all user data in two main tables: one for decks and another for cards. Each deck can consist of multiple cards, with unique identifiers (UUIDs) ensuring data integrity and preventing duplication. Users can interact with the application through a series of intuitive prompts, allowing for smooth navigation even for those unfamiliar with command-line tools.

Thoughtcards CLI supports various features aimed at enhancing the user experience. Users can choose from different shuffle modes, such as forward, backward, or random, when reviewing cards, adding an element of unpredictability that can aid in memorization. The application also provides straightforward options for managing decks and cards, including the ability to create new cards, edit existing ones, and delete those that are no longer needed.

To use Thoughtcards CLI, users must create a database using the included script and then run the application to access its features. The program is structured to guide users through each step, ensuring that they can efficiently manage their learning materials. Overall, Thoughtcards CLI combines user-friendly design with powerful functionalities, making it a valuable tool for anyone looking to improve their study habits and organization of learning resources.
